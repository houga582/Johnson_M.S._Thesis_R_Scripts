# Description
This GitHub repository contains annotated R scripts that code for all tables and figures contained in my M.S. thesis. 
The intent of this GitHub repository is to serve as a central location for all my R scripts. As I receive feedback on my figures, I will commit coding changes **HERE** . 
The purpose is to retain my R code so I can: 

- Clarify and confirm any information contained in the exported tables and figures
- Return to my progress rather than having to recode from scratch
- Be able to reproduce what I did upon request!
